## Security Considerations for Code Generation Tools

This toolkit generates code and shell scripts for AI agents and includes critical security considerations:

### Code Generation Security
- **Output Validation**: All generated code is validated for syntax errors
- **Template Safety**: Code templates do not include arbitrary code execution
- **Input Sanitization**: User inputs are sanitized to prevent code injection
- **Safe Defaults**: Generated code follows secure coding practices by default

### Shell Script Generation
- **Command Injection Prevention**: All shell commands are properly escaped
- **Path Validation**: File paths in scripts are validated and sanitized
- **Privilege Minimization**: Scripts generated with minimal necessary permissions
- **Security Scanning**: Built-in security analysis for generated scripts

### Static Analysis Tools
- **Secret Detection**: Tools scan for hardcoded secrets and credentials
- **Pattern Matching**: Secure pattern matching without executing code
- **Read-Only Operations**: Analysis tools do not modify source code
- **Safe Parsing**: Uses Python's AST module for safe code parsing

### Git Operations
- **Read-Only**: Git tools only read repository data, no write operations
- **Command Injection Prevention**: Git commands are properly parameterized
- **Path Safety**: Repository paths are validated before operations

### Best Practices for Agent Deployments
1. **Review Generated Code**: Always review generated code before execution
2. **Validate Inputs**: Validate all user inputs before passing to generation functions
3. **Limit Permissions**: Run code generation with minimal necessary permissions
4. **Monitor Usage**: Log and monitor agent code generation activities
5. **Sandbox Execution**: Test generated code in isolated environments first
6. **Regular Updates**: Keep the toolkit updated to receive security patches

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### Where to Report
- **Email**: Send details to unseriousai@gmail.com with subject "SECURITY: coding-open-agent-tools"
- **GitHub**: For non-critical issues, you may create a private security advisory on GitHub

### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Example of vulnerable code generation (if applicable)
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: 1-7 days depending on complexity
- **Fix Release**: Target within 14 days for critical issues
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

### Process
1. **Report Received**: We acknowledge receipt and begin investigation
2. **Validation**: We reproduce and assess the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Release**: We release a patched version
5. **Disclosure**: We publicly disclose details after users can update

### Security Updates
Security fixes are released as patch versions (e.g., 0.1.1 â†’ 0.1.2) and are immediately available via:
- PyPI package updates
- GitHub releases with security tags
- Security advisories on GitHub

## Known Security Considerations

### Code Generation Risks
- **Injection Attacks**: Generated code could be vulnerable if user inputs are not validated
- **Privilege Escalation**: Generated scripts could request more permissions than necessary
- **Information Disclosure**: Generated code might inadvertently expose sensitive information

### Mitigation Strategies
- Always validate user inputs before code generation
- Review generated code for security issues before use
- Use security scanning functions on all generated code
- Follow principle of least privilege in generated scripts
- Test generated code in isolated environments

Thank you for helping keep coding-open-agent-tools secure!
